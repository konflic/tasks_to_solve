Write a function, which accepts time delta specifier as a string argument and returns time interval in seconds as an integer. 

Supported time units: s – second, m – minute, h – hour, d – day, with seconds being default unit and 1 being default value. 

Please supply unit tests for the solution.

Examples of input time delta specifier and output value:

30 -> 30

30s -> 30

s -> 1

60.5m -> 3630

10seconds -> Exception raised

1m30s -> Exception raised

1y -> Exception raised

<empty string> -> Exception raised
